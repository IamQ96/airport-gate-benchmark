# Data Schemas – Airport Gate Benchmark

## Purpose

This document defines the core data schemas used in the Airport Gate Benchmark framework.

The schemas specified here act as strict data contracts between:
- data generation modules,
- simulation and gate assignment algorithms,
- evaluation and KPI computation,
- and future AI / reinforcement learning components.

Once defined, these schemas must remain stable to ensure reproducibility,
comparability of results, and extensibility of the benchmark.

## Flights Table

Each row represents a single **flight turn** that requires gate assignment.
A flight turn occupies a gate from arrival until departure, including any required turnaround buffer.

### Input Fields

| Column name    | Type      | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| flight_id     | string    | Unique identifier of the flight turn |
| arr_sched     | datetime  | Scheduled arrival time |
| dep_sched     | datetime  | Scheduled departure time |
| aircraft_class| category  | Aircraft size class (e.g. S, M, L) |
| pax_est       | integer   | Estimated passenger count (optional) |

### Derived Fields (Generated by Simulation)

The following fields are not provided as inputs, but are generated during scenario creation or simulation.

| Field name | Type     | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| arr_actual| datetime | Actual arrival time after disruptions |
| dep_actual| datetime | Actual departure time after disruptions |
| delay_arr | float    | Arrival delay in minutes |
| delay_dep | float    | Departure delay in minutes |

## Gates Table

Each row represents a physical airport gate with fixed compatibility
and passenger accessibility characteristics.

| Column name        | Type          | Description |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| gate_id            | string        | Unique gate identifier |
| compatible_classes | list[string]  | Aircraft classes that can be served by the gate |
| walk_cost          | float         | Passenger walking cost proxy (normalized) |

---

## Assignments Table (Simulation Output)

Each row represents the assignment of a flight to a gate over a specific time interval.

| Column name      | Type      | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| flight_id        | string    | Flight identifier |
| gate_id          | string    | Assigned gate identifier |
| start_time       | datetime  | Gate occupation start time |
| end_time         | datetime  | Gate occupation end time |
| is_reassigned    | boolean   | Indicates whether the flight was reassigned |
| conflict_minutes | float     | Duration of gate conflict in minutes (0 if none) |

---

## KPI Summary Table

Key performance indicators computed per scenario and per gate assignment policy.

| Metric name               | Type    | Description |
|---------------------------|---------|-------------|
| total_conflict_minutes    | float   | Sum of all gate conflict durations |
| num_conflicts             | integer | Number of gate conflicts |
| avg_gate_utilization      | float   | Mean gate utilization ratio |
| gate_utilization_var      | float   | Variance of gate utilization |
| propagated_delay_minutes  | float   | Delay caused by gate unavailability |
| num_reassignments         | integer | Number of gate reassignments |
| passenger_cost            | float   | Passenger-weighted walking cost |

## Schema Stability

The schemas defined in this document represent **version 1.0**
of the Airport Gate Benchmark data contract.

Future extensions must be backward-compatible and must not modify
existing fields.
