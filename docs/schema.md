# Data Schemas – Airport Gate Benchmark

## Purpose

This document defines the core data schemas used in the Airport Gate Benchmark framework.

The schemas specified here act as strict data contracts between:
- data generation modules,
- simulation and gate assignment algorithms,
- evaluation and KPI computation,
- and future AI / reinforcement learning components.

Once defined, these schemas must remain stable to ensure reproducibility, comparability of results, and extensibility of the benchmark.
