  # Fields:
  # - walk_cost: normalized passenger walking proxy (lower = closer/better)
  # - zone: coarse terminal zone label (for analysis + passenger impact)
  # - has_bridge: whether contact stand / jet bridge exists
  # - remote_stand: if true, implies bus transfer penalty (can be modeled later)

assumptions:
  - "One flight occupies exactly one gate for the interval [arr_actual, dep_actual + buffer]."
  - "Gate compatibility is modeled via aircraft size classes only (S/M/L)."
  - "walk_cost is a normalized proxy used for passenger-weighted KPIs; not a physical distance."
  - "Remote stands are represented via walk_cost/penalty and can be extended with explicit bus-transfer penalties."
